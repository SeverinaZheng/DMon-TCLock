# Application-Informed Kernel Synchronization Primitives

SynCord is a framework to modify kernel locks without recompiling or rebooting
the kernel. It abstracts key behaviors of kernel locks and exposes them as APIs
for designing user-defined kernel locks. SynCord provides the mechanisms to
customize kernel locks safely and correctly from userspace.
